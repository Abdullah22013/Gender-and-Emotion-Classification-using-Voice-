Description:

This repository contains all the codes and work done for Machine Learning Group project on the topic of Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction Project taken under CSE343 : Machine leanring course under Jainendra Shukla sir at IIIT - Delhi in Monsoon 2024 semester. The project aims predict employee attrition using machine learning models, leveraging the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset. 

In this project, we:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends related to attrition.
- Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.
